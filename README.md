### Difficulty

### Strengths

### Weaknesses
* There are 11 steps the students have to work through in order to verify that their program is linked to their Twitter account, providing several opportunities for students to misread or skip an important direction.  Since the main point of the assignment does not deal with getting Twitter up and running, I try to provide as much support as needed to get the students to the programming part as quickly as possible.
* Many high schools do not permit teachers to require students to make social media accounts outside the ones provided or supported by the school district.  If a student does not want to make their own Twitter account, I provide a flat file of tweets from a public Twitter feed they choose which they can use as an input file.  Students are still working with real Twitter data and are able to benefit from the assignment like their peers.    
* Twitter might be blocked on student workstations.  If so, I tell the students they can either work on the assignment at home or they can use the flat file that I described above.
